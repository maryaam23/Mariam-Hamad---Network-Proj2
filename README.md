Network Project in packet tracker 


Part 1:
In your own words, explain briefly the function of: DHCP, DNS, ICMP.
Using wireshark software, sniff DHCP, DNS, and ICMP packets, show the series of packets for each service that complete the request and service response,  choose one packet from each service and explain at least 5 fields.

Part 2:
Using packet tracer, build a network that contains at least 4 routers â€“do not use ring topology- 2 switches, 5 PCs. 
Use OSPF routing protocol
At least in one subnet uses DHCP
The network should contain a webserver 
The network should contain a DNS server
Build the IP addresses using your university ID (ID of one student of a group is enough)
If the ID is 1201234=120xyzw then the IP should be 205.x.y.0/24 
You should do proper Subnetting.
Using ping command to show reachability from one host to another host.
Use tracert command to show the path a packet traversed to reach its destination from each subnet host to a remote destination.
